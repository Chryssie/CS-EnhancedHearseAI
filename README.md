Oversees death services to ensure that hearses are dispatched in an efficient manner. 

## Inside a district
For cemeteries and crematoriums that reside within a district, the hearses they dispatch will only pick up corpses WITHIN THAT DISTRICT. They will NOT pick up corpses outside the district, even if they are driving right past the corpses. 

## Outside a district
For cemeteries and crematoriums that do not belong to any district, the hearses they dispatch will only pick up corpses that also do not belong to any district. Corpses within districts are expected to be addressed by the districts. Please note that there is a range to this pickup: the hearses will only go as far as the cemetery/crematorium's range allows. 

## Conflict resolution
Each cemetery/crematorium gets its own dispatcher. The dispatcher will try to maximize the efficiency of all its hearses, i.e., reduce the chance that two hearses will be sent to the same location for pick up. HOWEVER, just like in real life, the dispatchers of different cemeteries/crematoriums will not call each other constantly to make sure they are not all dispatching for the same corpse. So, if you have multiple cemeteries within the same district, it is possible that a corpse will be fought over by hearses from different cemeteries. With that said, it shouldn't be a common occurrence.
